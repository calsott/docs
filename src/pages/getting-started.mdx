# Getting Started

## Installation

We recommend to run it without installing, using `npx`:

```bash
npx calsott-cli
```

But, if you need to install the CLI, run:

```bash
npm install calsott-cli
# or 
yarn add calsott-cli
#or
pnpm install calsott-cli
```

After installation, you can run the CLI with:

```bash
calsott-cli
```

## Options

When running the CLI, you can pass the following options:

- `--config`: Path to config file, for example `--config ./my-config.js`. Default: `./calsott.js`
  - See the [configuration section](/config-file) for more details
