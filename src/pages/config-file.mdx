# Configuration

All the configuration should be done in the config file.

The config file is located in the root of the project and is called `.calsott.js`, but you could use
a custom name and place it elsewhere if you use `--config` option when running the CLI.

Take a look at the following next.config.js example:
  
```js
module.exports = {
  urls: [],
  providers: []
}
```

## URLs to check

Add the URLs you want to check in the `urls` array. 

Each URL object should have:

- `href`: the URL to check (required)
- `tags`: an array of tags (strings) to add to the metrics sent to the providers, for that URL.

An example of a URL object:

```js
{
  href: "https://docs.calsott.com",
  tags: ["page:introduction"]
}
```

## Providers

Add the providers you want to use in the `providers` array. All providers will receive the metrics of all the URLs.

> ⚠️ Each provider object could be different. Please, check the documentation of each provider to see how to configure it.

## Full example

See a full example of a config file below:

```js
module.exports = {
  urls: [
    {
      href: "https://docs.calsott.com",
      tags: ["page:introduction"]
    }
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      name: "datadog",
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.DATADOG_API_KEY,
        appKey: process.env.DATADOG_APP_KEY,
        site: "datadoghq.eu",
        host: "docs.calsott.com",
        prefix: "docs."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
