# Datadog Provider

The Datadog provider allows you to send web performance metrics to Datadog

## What are Datadog metrics?

Datadog metrics are numerical values that can track anything about your environment over time, from latency to error rates to user signups.
We use Datadog metrics to monitor each Core Web Vital metric for each page load.

Check out the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/) to learn more about Datadog metrics.

## How to use the Datadog provider?

To use the Datadog provider, you need to add the following provider code to your `.calsott.js` config file,
inside the `providers` array.

```js
{
  name: "datadog",
  options: {
    apiKey: process.env.DATADOG_API_KEY,
    appKey: process.env.DATADOG_APP_KEY,
    site: "datadoghq.eu",
    host: "twinandchic.com", 
    prefix: "tc." 
  }
}
```

This provider configuration accepts the following options:

* `name` - The name of the provider. It must be `datadog` in lowercase. (required)
* `options` - An object containing the provider options. (required)

Some options are required, and some are optional. See the most common options below:

* `apiKey` - Your Datadog API key. (required)
* `appKey` - Your Datadog application key. (required)
* `prefix` - A prefix to add to all metrics. (optional)
* `host` - The host name to associate with metrics.`  (optional)
* `site` - The Datadog site to send metrics to. Default: `datadoghq.com` (optional)
* `defaultTags` - An array of tags to add to all metrics. Default: `[]` (optional)
  * Set tags that are common to all metrics.

> We use `datadog-metrics` package to send metrics to Datadog. You can find the full list of options in the [node-datadog-metrics documentation](https://github.com/dbader/node-datadog-metrics)

## How to send different tags to each URL metrics?

In the configuration file, you can add a `tags` array to each URL object. This tags will apply only for that URL.

```js
module.exports = {
  urls: [
    {
      href: "https://calsott.com",
      tags: ["page:home"]
    }
  ],
}
```
