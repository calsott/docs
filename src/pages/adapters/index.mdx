# Continous Integration Adapters

Calsott is compatible with the following CI:

üëâ GitHub Actions

üëâ Gitlab CI

> ‚ö†Ô∏è See the [Roadmap](/roadmap#adapters) to know what comes next.

## What is an adapter?

An adapter is a piece of code that allows Calsott get information from CI run and use it to add
context to the metrics that it will send to providers.

For example, the branch name or the commit hash are information that can be used to add valuable
information to metrics when we develop new features or we are improving the application performance.

## What are the benefits of it?

It will help you to understand how your changes are affecting the performance of your application.
Detect performance regressions and identify when and where they happened.

## What happens when I run Calsott outside of a CI?

Calsott will try to get the information from the environment variables and if it can't find it,
it can not use them.

You can run Calsott locally and it will work as expected, but you will not be able to use CI metadata information.
